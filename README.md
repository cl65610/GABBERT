NFL players are never more expensive than when they hit the open market of free agency. GABBERT is a tool designed to give coaches, general managers, and agents the information necessary to more accurately predict player development in the final year of their rookie contract. Using statistics, advanced analytics, and athletic measures, GABBERT uses the first three years of a player's career in order to predict future success. GABBERT also creates a player comparison system for reference. GABBERT'S predictions are position-based. Specific information on how individual positions are evaluated can be found via the links below.
