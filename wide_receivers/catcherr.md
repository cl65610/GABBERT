## CATCHERR Explained

The success of GABBERT is largely based on our ability to accurately evaluate players. The creation of an accurate and informative metric is important because it will be used both as a target for our modeling, but also because it gives us and anyone using GABBERT an easy way to talk about the quality of season a player had without having to hold several different statistics in their mind at once. 

CATCHERR (The Combined Algorithm for Target-, Catch-, and Hands-Efficiency Receiver Rating) has many advantages that make it ideal for this type of work: 
  * Usage is considered - Player ratings are affected by what percetage of ther team's offense they were responsible for
  * Advance Analytics are incorporated
  * Players who are responsible for creating more offense (ie. players with high yards after the catch, players with lots of "big" plays, etc.) are rewarded for this
  * Scalability. A player can receive a CATCHERR rating for a single game, several games, a season, or a career. This allows for multiple degrees of comparison between players. 

As a way of introducing CATCHERR further, below is a graph showing receiver production for the 2015 season. The number of receptions a player had is plotted against their Compiled CATCHERR score.

As the graph makes pretty clear, Antonio Brown and Julio Jones were operating in a different realm from the other WRs in the league. Below them in the next tier of wide receivers are familiar names like Odell Beckham, A.J. Green, and DeAndre Hopkins. One of the great benefits of CATCHERR is that it highlights receivers performing at high levels who don't play for large-market teams. This graph can give the casual fan an appreciation for what an impressive season Brandon Marshall, Jeremy Maclin, or Allen Robinson had. 

For the purposes of this project, CATCHERR will be most useful highlighting the differences between mid-tier wide receievers. If a team is lucky enough to have a player like DeAndre Hopkins, their decision to sign him to an extension should be a given. GABBERT will attempt to provide guidance to teams for players who may be reliable, quality NFL players before they break out.
